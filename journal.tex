\begin{abstract}
  We present a fully analytical implementation of the core-valence separation (CVS) scheme for the equation-of-motion
  (EOM) coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) method for calculations of core-level states. In the spirit of
  the original CVS approximation proposed by Cederbaum, Domcke and Schirmer, pure valence excitations are excluded from
  the EOM target space and  the frozen-core approximation is imposed on the reference-state amplitudes and multipliers.
  This yields an efficient, robust, and accurate EOM-CCSD framework for calculations of excitation and ionization energies as well as state and transition properties (e.g., spectral intensities, natural transition and Dyson orbitals).
The accuracy of the new scheme is improved relative to the results obtained applying the CVS only
during the solution of the EOM eigenvalue equations. 
The errors in absolute excitation/ionization energies relative to the experimental reference data are of the order of 0.2--3.0 eV, depending on the K-edge considered and on the basis set used, 
and the shifts are systematic for each edge. 

%RESOLVED.. TEHRE IS A RESIDUAL ERROR
%{\bf I have a question about the shifts that we apply for EOM-EE. I suspect that if we compute EE relative to the corresponding IPs, then we will not need shifts for EE and only for IP. Can we test this quickly?}
%{\bf Sonia: it might not work all the time, as IPs do not always follow , but we can test it}

\section{Introduction}

By providing tunable high-energy radiation, advanced light sources
such as X-ray free electron laser (X-FEL) and synchrotron installations enable a variety of X-ray based spectroscopies\cite{Lamberti:XRay:2016,Mobilio:XRay:2014,Bergmann:FEL:17}.
Recent advances in beam quality greatly expanded possible applications of X-rays, giving rise to a proliferation of techniques, including those operating in time-resolved and non-linear
regimes \cite{Mobilio:XRay:2014,Lamberti:XRay:2016,Bergmann:FEL:17,Atto:Rev:17,Norman:ChemRev:18}.  
Fundamentally, these spectroscopies exploit electronic transitions involving core orbitals. 
Since core-level binding energies are characteristic of a species, X-ray absorption and
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XAS and XPS, respectively) 
are powerful techniques for probing electronic structure of atoms and molecules~\cite{Stohr1992}.
The localized nature of core orbitals makes X-ray based spectroscopies sensitive to local environment.  
However, just as in the case of VUV-based techniques\cite{Ahmed:ARPC:16},
theoretical modeling is required to unambiguously assign spectral features and to
relate experimental measurements to molecular structures. 
The experimental advances over the past decade have been driving the interest in developing highly accurate theoretical methods for X-ray spectroscopy and, in particular, for time-resolved XAS, which is proving to be a powerful mean to investigate molecular dynamics~\cite{Norman:ChemRev:18,naturecomm,Milne2014,kraus2018}.

Owing to its low computational costs relative to \textit{ab initio} methods, time-dependent (TD) density functional theory (DFT) has been the most commonly used technique for modeling absorption spectra\cite{Besley:CoreDFTPersp:10}.
However, TDDFT often fails to deliver an accurate description of spectroscopic properties. Thus, there is an evident need for reliable wave-function-based methods for calculations of XAS spectra. Although more expensive, these methods can be systematically improved, thereby yielding to
results of controlled accuracy\cite{OlsenText}. The focus of this contribution is on coupled-cluster (CC)
approaches~\cite{koch1990,Stanton:93:EOMCC,Christiansen_IJQC,krylov_eom_2008,WF_Properties_Review,CC_EOMCC_Bartlett,Christiansen2006,Christiansen:EOMRev:11},
which are among the most successful \textit{ab initio} methods for molecular properties, 
for describing X-ray absorption and ionization phenomena\cite{coriani2012jctc,Peng2015,coriani2012pra,coriani2015jcp,naturecomm}.

Although ionization or excitations of core electrons superficially appear to be similar to valence transitions, the numerical experiments have shown that direct application of
standard approaches to core-level transitions leads to unsatisfactory results\cite{Norman:ChemRev:18}, due to the following essential features of core-ionized and core-excited states. 
First, these states have open-shell character\cite{Krylov:OSRev}.
Second, the core-level states lie very high in energy (hundreds of electron volts, depending on the edge).
Third, orbital relaxation effects are much more important
for core states than for valence states because the outer orbitals are more delocalized and better shielded from the nuclear charge than the tight and localized core orbitals.
Fourth, these transitions appear to be much more sensitive to the effect of the
environment\cite{Sadybekov:CoreIE:17,Kongsted:DECore:18}.
Fifth, these high-lying states are metastable with respect to electron ejection\cite{Reinhardt:CS:1982,KrylovResReview}, i.e., they are Feshbach resonances 
that can autoionize via two-electron transitions
in which one valence electron fills the core hole and a second valence electron is ejected.
Thus, they are embedded in the ionization continuum and their description within Hermitian quantum
mechanics is problematic. 

Multistate methods, such as EOM-CC \cite{Emrich:81:EOM1,koch1990,Stanton:93:EOMCC,Christiansen2006,krylov_eom_2008,Christiansen:EOMRev:11,CC_EOMCC_Bartlett}, can effectively describe multiconfigurational wavefunctions, tackle open-shell character and  orbital relaxation effects in one computational scheme. The effect of the environment can be included by using a variety of implicit or explicit solvent models. 
However, dealing with high-energy interior states,
especially with those embedded in autodetaching continuum, is more problematic.  
Although the Davidson procedure can be modified
to solve for the eigenstates dominated by the desired transition (MOM-like\cite{Gill:MOM:08}) or
lying within the desired energy range\cite{Zuev:Solvers:14,XLi:ShiftedDavidson:15},
the convergence and numeric stability are strongly affected by the presence of the continuum.
An attempt to compute such states often produces pseudo-continuum states in which one electron occupies the most diffuse orbital\cite{Zuev:PYP:10}. Because in Hermitian
quantum mechanics, the resonances are not represented by a single state, but rather by an increased density of states in the continuum\cite{Moiseyev:Book:11}, 
the representation of resonances in a discretized continuum is inherently prone to numeric instabilities.
Although the EOM-CC methods can  describe resonances by using complex-scaled and
CAP-augmented approaches\cite{KrylovResReview},
such calculations are much more expensive than regular bound-state
calculations. Here we focus on alternative, less expensive approximate
methods for modeling spectroscopic properties of the core-level states.

Our strategy for tackling issues due to the continuum nature of the core levels
is based on employing the core-valence separation (CVS) approximation proposed by \citeauthor{Cederbaum1980}
in 1980~\cite{Cederbaum1980}. By decoupling the core excitations  from the rest of the configurational space, 
CVS allows one to extend standard methods for excited and ionized states to the core-level states\cite{wenzel2014,wenzel2015,coriani2015jcp}.
Effectively, CVS results in decoupling of the highly excited core states from the continuum of valence excitations; it also leads to a significant reduction of the computational costs.
The core states can also be decoupled from the continuum by excluding double excitations 
from the configurational space and treating them perturbatively\cite{Sadybekov:CoreIE:17}. 
Although numerically stable,
this approach suffers from insufficient description of orbital relaxation\cite{Sadybekov:CoreIE:17}.
Because the CVS approximation admits selected double excitations that are crucial for describing orbital relaxation, CVS-EOM/LR-CCSDs\cite{coriani2015jcp} yields negligible decline in accuracy, as compared 
to full EOM-CCSD/LR-CCSD results~\cite{coriani2012pra,coriani2012jctc,fransson2013jcp}.

The implementation of CVS within EOM-CC and Linear Response (CCLR) theories has been reported by \citeauthor{coriani2015jcp}\cite{coriani2015jcp}. In this work, CVS was deployed as an {\em{a posteriori}} projection applied at each iteration of the solution of the EOM/CCLR equations to eliminate excitations that do not involve at least one core electron, 
whereas the ground state amplitudes and Lagrangian multipliers retained all possible types of excitations.  
Here, a different strategy is presented: the zero-order wave-function parameters are computed within the frozen-core (fc) approximation and the subsequent EOM/CCLR equations are solved analytically imposing the core-valence separation. 
The respective state and transition properties such as oscillator strengths, natural transition orbitals (NTOs), Dyson orbitals, exciton descriptors, and so on are obtained from the appropriate densities between different target-state manifolds. Specifically, transition properties  
can be computed between the ground state and the core-excited state, as well as between a valence-excited and a core-excited state. 
This yields an efficient scheme for simulating, e.g., near-edge absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra of both ground and excited states. The latter is required to simulate UV-pump/X-ray-probe experiments and to obtain core-ionization potentials and Dyson orbitals for XPS spectra of medium size molecules.
We report illustrative results for NEXAFS and core IEs
of all K-edges in neon, water, ammonia, ethylene, vinylfluoride, ozone, adenine, as well as the 
transient (time-resolved) NEXAFS spectrum of uracil.


\section{Theory}

\subsection{EOM-CCSD}
In the EOM-CC approach, the target-state wave functions are parameterized using the
following ansatz:~\cite{sekino1984linear,Stanton:93:EOMCC,CC_EOMCC_Bartlett,krylov_eom_2008}
\begin{equation}
\langle \Psi_L | = \langle \Phi_0 | e^{-T} {L}~~;
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
\quad \quad \quad | \Psi_R \rangle =  e^{T} {R}| \Phi_0 \rangle 
\end{equation}
where $| \Phi_0 \rangle $ is a reference Slater determinant and \textit{T}, \textit{R} and $L^\dagger$ are excitation operators.\\
The excitation operator \textit{T} is the cluster operator:\cite{Note-1}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
T &= \sum_{\mu} t_{\mu} \tau_{\mu} = T_1 + T_2 + \dots + T_N \\
T_1 &= \sum_{ia} t_i^a a_a^{\dagger}a_i ,\hspace{0.3cm}  T_2 = \frac{1}{4}\sum_{ijab} t_{ij}^{ab} a_a^{\dagger}a_i a_b^{\dagger}a_j ,\hspace{0.3cm}\dots 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
with $\tau_{\mu}$ being the excitation operator and $t_{\mu}$ the corresponding cluster amplitudes determined by the CC equations for the reference state:
\begin{equation}
\langle \Phi_\mu | \bar{H} - E_\text{CC} | \Phi_0 \rangle = 0~~; 
\qquad\qquad E_\text{CC} = \langle \Phi_0| \bar{H} | \Phi_0 \rangle
\end{equation}
where $\langle \Phi_\mu |$'s represent $\mu$-tuple excited determinants and $\bar{H}$ is the similarity transformed Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation}
\bar{H} = e^{-T} H e^{T}.
\end{equation}
The operator $R$ is a general excitation operator:
  \begin{equation}
   R = R_0 + R_1 + \dots + R_n \equiv \sum_\mu r_\mu \tau_\mu
   \end{equation}
and $L$ is a de-excitation operator:
  \begin{equation}
   L = L_0 + L_1 + \dots + L_n \equiv \sum_\mu l_\mu \tau^\dagger_\mu
   \end{equation}
  The choice of the reference state and the exact form of $R$ and $L$ depend on the EOM method to be used\cite{krylov_eom_2008,CC_EOMCC_Bartlett}.
  Furthermore, in practical calculations the excitation operators must be truncated to some tractable level of excitation. 
In this work, we focus on the EOM-CCSD family of methods in which
the cluster operator $T$ is truncated to single (S) and double (D) excitations, and so are the excitation $R$ and de-excitation $L$ operators.

One of the most obvious applications of EOM theory is the calculation of electronically excited states\cite{sekino1984linear,Stanton:93:EOMCC}. In this approach, referred to as EOM-EE (EOM for excitation energies), the optimal reference state is usually the closed-shell ground-state Hartree-Fock determinant and the $R$ and $L$ operators conserve the number of electrons and their spin, taking the following forms:
\begin{equation}
R^\text{EE}= \sum_{ia} r_i^a a_a^\dagger a_i + \frac{1}{4} \sum_{ijab} r_{ij}^{ab} a_a^\dagger a_b^\dagger a_i a_j + \dots
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
L^\text{EE}= \sum_{ia} l_i^a a_i^\dagger a_a + \frac{1}{4} \sum_{ijab} l_{ij}^{ab} a_i^\dagger a_j^\dagger a_a a_b + \dots
\end{equation}

Another common use of EOM is calculations of ionization energies by the EOM-IP (EOM for ionization potentials)
method\cite{Stanton:94:AnlDer,Stanton:EOMRev:03,PAP:EOMIP}. In this case, the excitation operator changes the number of electrons in the system, assuming the 
following from:
\begin{equation}
R^\text{IP}= \sum_{i} r_i a_i + \frac{1}{4} \sum_{ija} r_{ij}^{a} a_a^\dagger  a_i a_j + \dots
\end{equation}

The EOM amplitudes $r_\mu$ and $l_\mu$ are found as stationary points of the EOM functional:
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{\langle \Psi_L| H | \Psi_R \rangle}{\langle \Psi_L | \Psi_R \rangle} 
\end{equation}
By applying the bi-variational principle~\cite{Bivariational_Lowdin,levchenko2004equation}, one arrives  
to the non-symmetric eigenvalue problem:
\begin{equation}
\langle \Phi_\mu | \bar{H} - E | R \Phi_0 \rangle = 0~~; 
\qquad\qquad
\langle \Phi_0 L | \bar{H} - E | \Phi_\mu \rangle = 0, 
\end{equation}
where the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian are chosen to form a biorthogonal set\cite{Stanton:93:EOMCC}: 
\begin{equation}
\langle \Phi_0 L_i| R_j \Phi_0 \rangle = \delta_{ij}
\end{equation}

Thus, the implementation of EOM-CCSD method boils down to the diagonalization of the effective Hamiltonian $\bar{H}$ in the basis of the reference and of singly and doubly excited determinants, which can be written in matrix form as:
\begin{equation}
\bar{H} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
E_{CC} & \bar{H}_{OS} & \bar{H}_{OD} \\
0 & \bar{H}_{SS} & \bar{H}_{SD} \\
0 & \bar{H}_{DS} & \bar{H}_{DD} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
giving rise to the EOM-CCSD right and left eigenvalue equations:
\begin{equation}
\label{righteq}
\begin{pmatrix}
\bar{H}_{SS} - E_{CC} & \bar{H}_{SD} \\
\bar{H}_{DS} & \bar{H}_{DD} - E_{CC} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
R_1 \\
R_2 \\
\end{pmatrix} 
= \omega 
\begin{pmatrix}
R_1 \\
R_2 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{lefteq}
\begin{pmatrix}
L_1 & L_2 \\
\end{pmatrix} 
\begin{pmatrix}
\bar{H}_{SS} - E_{CC} & \bar{H}_{SD} \\
\bar{H}_{DS} & \bar{H}_{DD} - E_{CC} \\
\end{pmatrix}
= \omega
\begin{pmatrix}
L_1 & L_2 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is the energy difference with respect to the reference state.

In practice, Eqs.~\eqref{righteq} and \eqref{lefteq} are solved iteratively using a generalized Davidson's iterative diagonalization procedure\cite{Davidson,hirao1982generalization,rettrup1982iterative} which requires the computation of the right $\sigma$ and left $\tilde{\sigma}$ trial vectors:
\begin{equation} 
\sigma_1 = ([\bar{H}_{SS}-E_{CC}]R_1)_1 + (\bar{H}_{SD}R_2)_1
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
\sigma_2 = (\bar{H}_{DS}R_1)_2 + ([\bar{H}_{DD}-E_{CC}]R_2)_2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
\tilde{\sigma}_1 = (L_1[\bar{H}_{SS}-E_{CC}])_1 + (L_2\bar{H}_{DS})_1
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
\tilde{\sigma}_2 = (L_1\bar{H}_{SD})_2 + ([L_2\bar{H}_{DD}-E_{CC}])_2
\end{equation}

For calculating molecular properties, it is convenient to express the EOM energy using one- and two-particle density matrices:
\begin{equation}
E = \sum_{pq} h_{pq} \gamma_{pq} + \frac{1}{4} \sum_{pqrs} \langle pq ||rs \rangle \Gamma_{pqrs}
\end{equation}
where the one- and two-particle matrices are respectively:
\begin{equation}
\label{gamma}
 \gamma_{pq} = \frac{1}{2} \langle \Psi_L | a_p^\dagger a_q + a_q^\dagger a_p | \Psi_R \rangle
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \Gamma_{pqrs} = \frac{1}{2} \langle \Psi_L | a_p^\dagger a_q^\dagger a_s a_r + a_s^\dagger a_r^\dagger a_p a_q| \Psi_R \rangle
\end{equation}
In the present study, we focus on transition properties involving core states, specifically, the oscillator strengths $f$ between the ground state and the core-excited states, and between valence-excited and core-excited states. 
These can be formulated via contractions of property integral matrices and transition density matrices, for instance,
\begin{equation}
f (i \to j) = \frac{2}{3}(\omega_j - \omega_i) \sum_{\alpha=x,y,z} \mu^{i\to j}_{\alpha} 
\mu^{j\to i}_{\alpha}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
\mu_\alpha^{i\to j}
= \sum_{pq} \mu^{\alpha}_{pq} \gamma^{ i\to j}_{pq}~; \quad \quad
\mu_\alpha^{j\to i} = \sum_{rs} \mu^{\alpha}_{rs} \gamma^{j\to i }_{rs}
% \end{aligned}
\label{strength}
\end{equation}
Above, $\mu^\alpha$ refers to a specific Cartesian component of the electric dipole operator and the state $i$ can be either the ground state and an excited state.

The transition density matrices $\gamma^{i\to j}_{pq}$ and $\gamma^{j\to i}_{pq}$ are generalizations of Eq.~\eqref{gamma}, and their specific form in the fc-CVS-EOM-CCSD framework is discussed in the next sections.
Transition density matrices describe  the changes in electron density upon excitation and 
can be interpreted as exciton wavefunction\cite{Luzanov:TDM-1:76,Luzanov:DMRev:12,Plasser2012,Plasser2014}
when expressed in coordinate space:
\begin{equation}
\chi(r_p,r_h) = \sum_{pq} \gamma_{pq} \phi_p(r_p) \phi_q(r_h),
\end{equation}
where $r_p$ and $r_h$ denote particle (electron) and hole coordinates,
respectively (using $r_h=r_p=r$, $\chi$ is reduced to the transition density).  
Properties of the exciton can be quantified by various expectation
values, i.e., exciton size, hole-particle separation and correlation, and so on.
These exciton descriptors help to assign state characters\cite{Plasser2012,Plasser2014,Plasser2014:1}.
Applying a singular value decomposition (SVD) to the transition matrices yields the so-called NTOs~\cite{Martin2003,Plasser2012,Plasser2014,Plasser2014:1,Bappler2014,Mewes2018}, which can be used to
describe the electronic excitations in terms of hole-particle excitons:
\begin{equation}
\chi(r_p,r_h) = \sum_K \sigma_K  \tilde{\phi}^p_K(r_p) \tilde{\phi}^h_K(r_h),
\end{equation}
where $\tilde \phi^p_K$ and $\tilde \phi^h_K$ are particle and hole orbitals obtained by SVD 
of $\gamma$ and $\sigma_K$  
are the corresponding  singular values. Usually, only a few
$\sigma_K$ are non-zero, giving rise to simple interpretation of excited-state characters
in terms of one-electron excitations. Note that the sum of $\sigma_K^2$ is equal to the squared norm of $\gamma$, which provides a simple metric quantifying the single-electron character of the transition, i.e., for pure single excitations, $||\gamma||$=1. 

\subsection{The fc-CVS-EOM-CCSD method}

Core orbitals are strongly localized in space and energetically are well separated from the valence orbitals.
The CVS approximation~\cite{Cederbaum1980} exploits this fundamental feature to decouple core and valence orbitals by zeroing out the respective blocks of the model Hamiltonian, such that the solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation can be separated into core and valence domains.

The CVS has been realized for a variety of approximate 
wavefunction methods as well as for TDDFT.
Within the ADC (algebraic diagrammatic construction)
framework\cite{Dreuw:ADCrev:2014}, for instance, \citeauthor{wenzel2014}\cite{wenzel2014} observed that, in view of negligible coupling between core and valence orbitals, all the following two-electron Coulomb integrals are negligible
(small letters for general valence orbitals, and capital letters for core orbitals)
\begin{align}
\langle Ip|qr \rangle = \langle pI|qr \rangle = \langle pq|Ir \rangle =
\langle pq|rI \rangle \approx 0 \\\nonumber 
\langle IJ | pq \rangle = \langle pq |IJ \rangle \approx 0 \\\nonumber
\langle IJ | Kp \rangle = \langle IJ | pK \rangle = 
\langle Ip | JK \rangle = \langle pI | JK \rangle \approx 0
\end{align}
so that one can omit the blocks of the ADC propagator matrix ${\bf M}$ involving these integrals and therefore decouple pure valence excitations from excitations involving core electrons.
Since MP2 is an underlying wave-function for the ADC propagator\cite{Dreuw:ADCrev:2014}, omitting those integrals straightforwardly corresponds to using the frozen-core approximation for the MP2 ground state energy.

On the other hand, in the CVS-CC framework of Ref.~\citenum{coriani2015jcp}, an effective core-valence separation was introduced only in the solution of the eigenvalue equations since physically the core-excited states are energetically far away from the valence excited states.

If the criterion of negligible integrals is used within the CCSD ansatz in the canonical basis,~\cite{Purvis_and_Bartlett} the resulting CCSD energy and amplitude equations are identical to those obtained imposing the frozen-core approximation on the CC wave-function, i.e. by restricting the occupied indices in the cluster operator $T$ (and corresponding amplitudes) to valence occupied orbitals.

Therefore, it is justified to use the frozen core approximation in determining ground-state amplitudes $t$ and Lagrangian multipliers ${\lambda}$ and, at the same time, to impose that the excitation/ionization operators $R$ and $L$ involve at least one core orbital. 
This introduces restrictions on the left and right EOM equations, and on the density matrices used to obtain the molecular properties.   
We refer to the resulting approach as fc-CVS-EOM-CCSD method.


The programmable expressions for obtaining the right and left excitation vectors within the fc-CVS-EOM-CCSD methods have been derived from Ref.~\citenum{levchenko2004equation} and for the density matrices from Ref.~\citenum{levchenko2005analytic} and can be found in the Supplementary Information.\\
As an illustrative example, we only show how the expression of the right linearly transformed vector $\sigma_i^a$ is modified for the fc-CVS case. The general expression for

It is convenient to further split the occupied orbitals $(i,j,k,l,\ldots)$ into the two sub-blocks: occupied valence denoted by a subindex $v$ and occupied core orbitals denoted by a capital letter.
As anticipated, the CVS approximation is implemented by reducing the set of occupied orbitals to only the core ones in the excitation process and freezing the core in the ground state. 
Hence, by restricting the EOM excitations to core excitations only, all terms involving valence excitations disappear in the equations above. The frozen-core approximation further simplifies the equations since the terms involving ground-state amplitudes vanish for the core orbitals. The fc-CVS expression for the same trial vector thus reads as follows:
\begin{equation} 
\begin{aligned}
\sigma_I^a 
=& \sum_{b}r_I^b F_{ab} - \sum_{J}r_J^aF_{IJ}-\sum_{Jb}r_J^bI^1_{IbJa}

The same strategy has been followed for the derivation of the other linearly transformed vector blocks, as for the expressions of the (transition) density matrices.

\section{Computational details}
We implemented the fc-CVS-EOM-CC method in the Q-Chem electronic structure package~\cite{qchem_feature,Qchem_MP_paper} using
the libtensor library\cite{libtensor_paper}.
The geometries of \ce{H2O}, \ce{NH3}, \ce{CO}, \ce{C2H4}, \ce{C2H3F} and \ce{O3} were optimized at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ level using CFOUR~\cite{stanton2010cfour}. For 9H-adenine, we considered 
both planar and non-planar structures taken from the literature. The non-planar one was optimized at the RI-MP2/cc-pVTZ level~\cite{SarahMCD2018}, whereas the planar one was optimized at the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ level.~\cite{Santoro2014}
For the TR-NEXAFS simulations on uracil, we used different structures: an optimized MP2/cc-pVTZ ground-state structure, a ground-state structure and an S$_1$ geometry both optimized at the SF-BH\&HLYP/6-31+G(d,p) level from Ref.~\citenum{uracil_herbert}, and two stationary-point 
structures for the S$_1$ and S$_2$ excited states
obtained at the EOM-CCSD/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory. 
All structures were planar or almost planar.

Depending on the system, we considered different basis sets  in the (TR-)NEXAFS calculations:  Pople's 6-311++G** (pure $d$ functions), Dunning's aug-cc-pVDZ, aug-cc-pVTZ and aug-cc-pCVTZ sets. In selected cases, the basis sets were further augmented with uncontracted Rydberg-type functions whose exponents were computed according to the prescription of \citeauthor{Rydberg_basis}\cite{Rydberg_basis} 
Experimental data were taken from:  Ref.~\citenum{nexafs_thymine_adenine}
for adenine, Ref.~\citenum{Neon_exp} for Neon,
Ref.~\citenum{NEXAFS_H2O_NH3_CH4_Exp} for \ce{H2O} and \ce{NH3},
Ref.~\citenum{NEXAFS_CO_C_Exp} and~\citenum{NEXAFS_CO_O_Exp} for \ce{CO},
Ref.~\citenum{NEXAFS_C2H4_CH2CHF_Exp} for \ce{C2H4} and \ce{C2H3F} and Ref.~\citenum{ozone_nexafs_xps} for \ce{O3}.
The experimental NEXAFS spectrum of uracil is from Ref.~\citenum{nexafs_cytosine_uracil}.
All experimental spectra were digitized from the 
original references using WebPlotDigitizer~\cite{WPD}. 
The spectra were generated using a Python script and NTOs were visualized using MOLDEN~\cite{molden}.

\subsection{Core-level transient absorption spectroscopy}

The advances in X-ray Free-Electron Lasers in the last decade
have boosted the interest in computational methodologies to simulate of Time-Resolved X-ray Absorption (TR-XAS or TR-NEXAFS)~\cite{Milne2014,TransientXAS_H2O,acac_ultrafast_ISC,naturecomm}. Typically, in TR-NEXAFS pump-probe experiments, the sample is first brought to a valence excited state via UV radiation of appropriate wavelength, and then probed, at different time delays, with X-ray radiation. 
To simulate these processes, methods to compute the intensity of valence-to-core transitions  are needed.
An EOM-CCSD/CC3 methodology, based on the CVS approach of Ref.~\citenum{coriani2015jcp}, has been devised and used, for 
instance, to simulate and interpret TR-NEXAFS experiments in thymine~\cite{naturecomm}. The study aimed at assessing 
the ability of K-edge resonant absorption spectroscopy 
to probe ultrafast $\pi\pi^\star$/n$\pi^\star$ internal 
conversion in organic chromophores.
Other methodologies have also been devised within the ADC framework
by \citeauthor{Neville_ADC_TRNEXAFS}
\cite{Neville_ADC_TRNEXAFS,Neville_TRXAS,Neville_TRXAS_at_CI}, and at the TDDFT level by, e.g.,~\citeauthor{acac_ultrafast_ISC}\cite{acac_ultrafast_ISC}

We have extended the fc-CVS-EOM-CCSD formalism to the computation of  the transition density matrices between two excited states,
from which the transient X-ray absorption spectra can then be obtained.
As illustrative example, we have considered the valence-to-core spectra of uracil at the O, C and N edges. TR-NEXAFS spectra of uracil have not been experimentally measured yet, but they are expected to bear strong similarities with those of thymine, whose O-edge TR-NEXAFS was measured in Ref.~\citenum{naturecomm}.
Two valence excited states were considered, the first 
bright $\pi\pi^{\ast}$ state (S$_2$ at FC geometry) and the first dark n$_O\pi^{\ast}$ (S$_1$ at FC  geometry) state. The NTOs of these two states,
obtained at the Franck-Condon geometry, are shown in 
Table~\ref{uracil-ntos-valence}.

Given the localized nature of the n$_O\pi^{\ast}$ (S$_1$) state
on one of the two oxygen nuclei, and similar to what has been 
observed for thymine~\cite{naturecomm}, one can expect that the
TR-NEXAFS measurements at the O-edge are the best to probe the 
population of the n$_O\pi^{\ast}$ due to ultrafast internal conversion.
Indeed, we show in Figs.~\ref{fgr:uracil:trnexafs_uracil_o:DFT}
and~\ref{fgr:uracil:trnexafs_uracil_o:MP2CCSD}
the X-ray absorption spectra obtained at the O edge for 
both the ground and the two excited states at different optimized geometries for the ground and the two valence excited states.
In all cases, core excitation from the n$_O\pi^*$ state results in 
the emergence of a relatively strong and distinctive signal at around 526.0-526.5 eV, similar to what has been observed for thymine~\cite{naturecomm}.
The NTO of this excitation, labeled 1s$_O$n$_O$, is also shown in 
Table~\ref{uracil-ntos-valence}, clearly illustrating that the core electron fills the vacancy 
in the n$_O\pi^*$ excited state.

To conclude this section, we have also considered the transient state spectra that one could expect to observe if probing at the C and N edges after the initial pump, along with the computed ground state NEXAFS spectra and their experimental counterparts.  
Fig.~\ref{fgr:uracil:trnexafs_uracil_c} shows that at the C-edge the valence-to-core spectra
are rather weak (signals have been enhanced by a factor 10 in the figures),
and that, opposite to the O-edge case, 
the most intense features at this edge originate from the $\pi\pi^*$ excited state.
At the N-edge, see Fig.~\ref{fgr:uracil:trnexafs_uracil_n},
the intensities of the transient absorption spectra are higher than
at the C edge (signals have been enhanced by a factor 5 in the figures)
and, as in the C edge case, the dominant features are from 
the $\pi\pi^*$ excited state.

\section{Conclusions}
We have presented a new, fully-analytic core-valence separated equation-of-motion approach,
named fc-CVS-EOM-CCSD, for calculating spectral descriptors of X-ray absorption spectroscopies, specifically near-edge absorption fine structure, core-ionization energies and transient-state (time-resolved) X-ray absorption. The approach exploits the large energy separation of the core and valence orbitals both in the determination of the coupled cluster ground state wavefunction parameters and of the EOM target states.
We tested the methodology on a number of atomic and molecular systems. The shape of computed NEXAFS spectra agrees very well with the experimental one in terms of the relative heights of the individual peaks and the distance beween them. However, the computed spectra are shifted with respect to the experiment. The magitude of shifts required for the alignment varies between 0.2 and 3 eV, depending on the edge and basis set considered.
The shifts are in all cases smaller than those obtained with a previously presented CVS-CCSD approach based on the energy separation between core and valence excited states,~\cite{coriani2015jcp} whereas the spectral profiles are practically the same. Importantly, for all examples, we observed a systematic decrease of the shift upon the basis set increase.
The fully analytical implementation also delivers reduced computational 
cost relative to the projection technique used in Ref.~\citenum{coriani2015jcp}.
Simulations of the transient state NEXAFS spectra of uracil at all three edges 
supports the ability to probe the ultrafast internal conversion of this DNA basis by 
TR-NEXAFS, as recently experimentally and computationally verified for the thymine molecule~\cite{naturecomm}.
